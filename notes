The Game Loop
game events will occur, update, and get drawn to the surface
the game loop will iterate until an event of type QUIT occurs

while True:
  if event is quit:
    quit the game
  game logic

  pygame.display.update() - update the display of the game last

pygame.display.update() - this actually updates the game window / surfac
with changes made in this iteration of the game loop
'''

'''
quitting the game loop
use pygame.quit() AND sys.exit() - if we dont call pygame.quit, IDE might hang

# i saw people do running = True, then while running
while True:
  # this for loop can probably be made into a quit function
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == QUIT:  # QUIT is actually pygame.locals.QUIT
      pygame.quit()
      sys.exit()
  
  pygame.display.update()

'''
event objects in pygame
when the user performs some action - click a mouse, press a button, etc
pygame.event.get() - returns a list of pygame.event.Event objects
  the type attribute tells us what the event is
  we can also make custom events
'''

'''
Creating a display screen
we need to create a window of a fixed size:
  pass a tuple with width and height into display.set_mode()

DISPLAYSURF = pygame.display.set_mode((300, 300))  # this makes a 300x300 pixels screen
(0,0) coordinate is top left corner
'''

'''
pygame colors
use RGB system - pygame.Color(0,0,0)  # pass in RGB values to make color objects
'''

'''
frames per second
pygame does not limit fps by default. we would want to set it, so the loop doesnt run infinitely

FPS = pygame.time.Clock()
FPS.tick(60)  # 60fps
'''

'''
Rects and Collision Detection
in a game, each object has a fixed boundary - space it occupies
if it overlaps with another obj's boundary, then collision occurs
we can also check if the obj collides with a coordinate
